# miolo-js
Enterprise control solution built with JS environment, with Node.js, MongoDB, Next.js and React Native.

## Concept and idea

I was looking for some idea to apply all the concepts aquired in my new studies. So I had the idea to build paralelly, a better, faster and stronger version of my miolo-v2 app, which is an old school Laravel application.

The original project is very simple and uses, in higher level, asset pre-processing. Now the goal is to build this side version using a lot of better tools and frameworks.

And another great challange: I'm teending to build a data migration tool. So, if the Miolo company likes this new version, we gonna have no trouble for bringging it to live!

Let's see what happens!
